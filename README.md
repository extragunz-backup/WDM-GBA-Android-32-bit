# WDM-GBA-Android-32-bit
WillDaMan version of MGBA for the 32 bit Android platform.
I am going to start with the very first version of MGBA for Linux, and keep on working my way up until i get to the latest 32 bit Linux version. Who knows about how long that will take, but i am going to make sure that this project stays for the rest of mankind. Before i am gone; i am going to give this project over to the MGBA emulator company, so they can continue this project.
